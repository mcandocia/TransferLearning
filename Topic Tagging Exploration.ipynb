    "1. The first sample does not use the words \"air travel/air-travel\" or \"bookings\", or \"airlines\". The title does use the word \"book\", though, in the context of \"booking\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Deep frying\" (non-hyphenated) is in the title. \"Taste\" is present several times, but \"flavor\" is only used at the very end, in a parenthetical statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Only presence of a keyword (\"chosen plantext attack\") is an instance of its acronym. Its definition would have to be found elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Only one key word is present in the content (\"public key\"), and \"one-way-function\" is sort-of present in the last paragraph, \"one-way-ish functions\". (Hyphenation is actually used here, but the -ish part of the English language is kind of funny)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"frying\" and \"oil\" and \"deep frying\" are all present in this body. Interestingly \"french fries\" are not the main focus here.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. AES and CBC acronyms are both present in the title, and AES is also present in body. IV is present in both title and body, but its definition (in parentheses) is present in the body as well. Its definition is the relevant tag. Perhaps the frequency of usage of acronyms vs. their full names should be analyzed to determine which one to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Apart from the mistake of visiting a poor country where everything is cooked in lard as a vegetarian who doesn't know the language...\"food-and-drink\" is a general category, which might be derived from context; \"Cuba\" can be inferred from the title, as it is not a very common subject and important to the topic at hand; \"dietary restrictions\" is probably inferable from the constant use of \"vegetarian\", and possibly from the consistent uses of first-person verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. This would be a hard example. There are references to people, which might allow \"human-biology\" to come into play via context; and \"looking at (X)\" might relate to \"eyes\", and \"trigger\" for \"reflexes\", and perhaps the indication of \"reflexes\" might relate \"looking at (X)\" to \"eyes\" more.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. While I could probably achieve a minimal level of performance by simply extracting words, using TF-IDF and a bit of conjugation, better performance requires mining the data set to determine how to form key words from the entire corpus, and figuring out where they are relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "3. First, I think some summary statistics should be extracted to get a better idea of what we're working with, segmented by source\n",

    "    a) How many times each key is used across all posts\n",

    "4. Second-order statistics and visualization may also prove useful to see if there's any structure that can be taken advantage of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Build a co-occurence network of keywords. Clustering may demonstrate generative behavior. Visualization in Gephi is possible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Identify some key words/phrases from each entry using standard methodology, and then build a dictionary for each keyword. Data reduction might have to be used if this is too memory-intensive.\n",

    "B. How do you relate the title and content of a question to the keywords?\n",
